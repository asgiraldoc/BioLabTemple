## BioLabTemple Tools Collection

This repository gathers a variety of small tools, scripts, and helper functions developed during my time as a student at the BioLab at Temple University.
These tools were created to support day-to-day work in bioinformatics, population genomics, phylogenetics, and general data processing tasks.

The goal of this repo is simple: keep everything organized, accessible, and easy to reuse — both for myself and anyone in the lab who might find these scripts helpful.
